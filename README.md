# 🌌 Starfall: Frontiers — Prototype (Game Off 2025)

> *“Thronefall among the stars — short sessions, simple choices, deep consequences.”*

---

## 🛰 Overview
**Starfall: Frontiers** is a minimalist sci-fi strategy inspired by *Thronefall*,  
where the player builds a base, defends against waves of enemies, and travels between planets,  
completing contracts for resource extraction.

The prototype focuses on:
- short, dynamic sessions (5–15 minutes);
- clear yet deep tactical gameplay;
- the first layer of **inter-session progression** (upgrades between missions);
- the theme of **WAVES** — as energy, attacks, and decisions.

---

## 🎯 Goal for Game Off 2025
Create a **playable prototype** showing the core gameplay loop:
- 1 planet (desert biome);
- 3 buildings: Energy Core, Turret, Mine;
- 3 enemy types: Drones, Mech Troopers, Siege Walker;
- a mech-hero with two weapon modes;
- basic wave system and victory after **5–7 attack waves**.

The goal is a solid foundation to expand into a full demo for **Tower Defense Festival 2026**.

## ⚙️ Core Loop
1. Land on a planet.  
2. Build your base and activate defense.  
3. Survive waves of enemies.  
4. Collect resources and evacuate.  
5. Use rewards for future upgrades (meta layer placeholder).

---

## 🧩 Theme Interpretation — “WAVES”
- Waves of enemy attacks.  
- Energy waves powering your defenses.  
- Waves of decisions shaping the journey between planets.  

> Simple missions. Deep consequences. A long path through the stars.
